description: In August of 1848, John Ruskin and his new bride visited northern France,
  for the gifted young critic wished to write a book that would examine the essence
  of Gothic architecture. By the following April, the book was finished. Titled The
  Seven Lamps of Architecture, it was far more than a treatise on the Gothic style;
  instead, it elaborated Ruskin's deepest convictions of the nature and role of architecture
  and its aesthetics. The book was published to immediate acclaim and has since become
  an acknowledged classic.
